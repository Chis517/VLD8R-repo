# VLD8R

## User Story 
The purpose of our project was to provide a service to provide more information on robo calls, spam emails and unknow Ip addresses. We used four api's for our project, one for each search criteria and the google maps api to help us locate the searches origin.  Our applications allows you to search for any phone number, email, or IP address and determine where it originates from, plus information to help you decide if it is safe to interact with. Once you've entered the criteria, it is saved locally for easy reference later on.
